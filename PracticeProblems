Practice Problems from Rika

You should be able to do these if you are in CS311

Store these in separate files for later use:

You may use only cin and cin.getline.
Run the program by doing ./a.out < inputfilename

1) write a program to read in a line at a time into a string
- convert each alphabetic character to lower case and store into a string
- display the line

2) write a program to read in a line at a time into a string
- extract out each word and display the word preceded by the counter
e.g. 1 apple  2 berry

3) write a program to read a character at a time
read into a and b alternatively in struct x {char a; int b};

4) write a program to find all combinations of letters in an array  
(set of 1, set of 2, set of 3 etc.)

5) write a program to find all permutations of letters in an array

6) write a program to find the length of a sequence of numbers
e.g.  1 2 3 4 7 9 = 4
e.g.  3 5 6 6 7 8 = 4 (repeated numbers in a sequence are skipped) 

Recall how to convert character digit into int digit. i.e. '1' to 1

Make sure you know how to display things at a specific column
   right justified (use setw)

Recall which data structure allows breath first search
 and which allows depth first.
